# Angular Screenfull

Angular screenfull is a wrapper around the [Screenfull library](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/), that allows you to use the [HTML5 fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Using_full_screen_mode), in "the Angular way".

You can [fork it on github](https://github.com/hrajchert/angular-screenfull).

## Note on examples

angular-animate and marked are not needed, but for some reason are added in the examples generated by [ngdoc](https://github.com/nikhilmodak/gulp-ngdocs)

## Install

#### Download via npm or look for the files in the dist folder

```sh
$ npm install --save angular-screenfull
```

#### Import it to your page

```html
<script src="node_modules/screenfull/dist/screenfull.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/angular-screenfull/dist/angular-screenfull.min.js"></script>
```

You need to have both [screenfull](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js) and angular-screenfull loaded in the browser in order to the directive to work. I have a an agular.js project using a custom loader, but if you want to add webpack support, PR's are welcomed.

#### Enable it on your app

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['angularScreenfull']);
```


# Use it

In its simplest form, you can do something like this


<example  module="myApp">
 <file name="app.js">
    angular.module('myApp', ['angularScreenfull']);
 </file>
 <file name="index.html">
    <div ngsf-fullscreen>
        <p>This is a fullscreen element</p>
        <button ngsf-toggle-fullscreen>Toggle fullscreen</button>
    </div>
 </file>
 <file name="main.css">
    .fullscreen {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
 </file>
</example>


The `ngsf-fullscreen` indicates which element is going to be the fullscreen element and the `ngsf-toggle-fullscreen`
will toggle the fullscren when clicked.

Note that you can have multiple `ngsf-fullscreen` elements living side by side, the other directives require that a
parent controller exists.

# A word in CSS

When the element that uses directive `ngsf-fullscreen` becomes fullscreen a class is added using the `$animation` service, so you can add animations to the transition.

Note that this library doesn't come with any CSS, so if you would like your element to occupy the whole screen (and I imagine that you want to), you should add something like this to your CSS.

```css
.fullscreen {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

# Export its functionality

You can also expose the element controller trough its directive name. So for example you can achieve the same result
using this

<example  module="myApp">
 <file name="app.js">
    angular.module('myApp', ['angularScreenfull']);
 </file>
 <file name="index.html">
    <div ngsf-fullscreen="fullscreenCtrl">
        <p>This is another fullscreen element</p>
        <button ng-click="fullscreenCtrl.toggleFullscreen()">Toggle fullscreen</button>
    </div>
 </file>
</example>

# Show or hide

We also provide directives to show the elements based on the fullscreen status, so for example you can have this

<example  module="myApp">
 <file name="app.js">
    angular.module('myApp', ['angularScreenfull']);
 </file>
 <file name="index.html">

    <div ngsf-fullscreen>
        <p>This is yet another fullscreen element</p>
        <a ngsf-toggle-fullscreen show-if-fullscreen-enabled>
            <i show-if-fullscreen=false>Icon for enter fullscreen</i>
            <i show-if-fullscreen=true>Icon for exit fullscreen</i>
        </a>
    </div>
</file>
</example>

# The problem with F11

As stated in [this bug](https://github.com/hrajchert/angular-screenfull/issues/1), it appears that browser vendors don't allow a user script to tap into the `F11` hotkey for security reasons. That means that we can only detect that the page is in fullscreen mode when the `HTML5 fullscreen API` is used.

If you can find a way to overcome this problem please let me know!
